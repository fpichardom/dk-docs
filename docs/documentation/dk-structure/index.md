# Knowledgebase Structure Overview

Resources in this knowledge base are organized using a two-level category system designed to make them easy to find and understand.

## Level 1: Type

The first level, **type**, classifies a resource based on its fundamental nature, generally following the Schema.org standard. This classification helps determine the most appropriate metadata for each item. For example, a `Video Object` has a "duration" field, while a `Software Application` has an "operating system" field.

The primary Types include:

- [Book](./book)
- [Digital Document](./digital-document)
- [Event](./event)
- [Learning Resource](./learning-resource)
- [Scholarly Article](./scholarly-article)
- [Software Application](./software-application)
- [Software Source Code](./software-source-code)
- [Video Object](./video-object)
- [Web Content](./web-content)

## Level 2: Category

The second level, **category**, is then assigned to provide more information about the resource's specific purpose. Because this classification is based on function, different Types can share the same Category. For instance, a resource categorized as a Protocol, Manual, or Blog Post could exist as either a webpage (Web Content) or a downloadable file (Digital Document).
