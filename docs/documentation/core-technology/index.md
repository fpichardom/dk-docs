# The Technology Behind the Knowledge Base

The technology powering this knowledge base is [**CKAN**](https://ckan.org/), an open-source platform renowned for its use in major Open Data repositories worldwide. It powers large government sites like [**Data.gov**](https://www.data.gov/), museums such as the [**Natural History Museum, London**](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/), and humanitarian projects like the [**Humanitarian Data Exchange**](https://data.humdata.org/).

We chose CKAN because its strong and flexible foundation allows us to customize the platform for our specific needs. These customizations include:

- Creating unique submission forms for each resource **Type**.
- Extending the metadata fields to build a more powerful and effective search interface.
